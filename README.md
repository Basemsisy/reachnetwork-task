## Note

There are some missing things in the UI But it's simple things, And in general most of the required tasks have been implemented, but some improvements can be made, such as:

- [ ] load data on scrolling (infinite scroll)
- [ ] inhance typescript types
- [ ] unit testing

and about part of (using flux architecture ), I found that I didn't need it and I used
[react query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) , it's a good lib to data fetching and depend on hooks
